Anaconda Build Recipes
======================

This repository contains conda build recipes made in part for Anaconda Inc.

End packages were:
1. cookiecutter-django
2. channels
3. phosphor
4. rxpy

The packages can be build on windows 10x64 and Centos 6.9x64 using the 
BuildOrder.bat and BuildOrder.sh. Please replace the channel for build.

Some of recipes were copied from conda-forge to satisfy dependencies.
